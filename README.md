# GradeBook
An app created to help keep track of grades and averages

NOTE: This Project is very old and in need of a major revamp.
I Plan to revisit this project in the future with a total revamp of the project.
This revamp will include better logging and data saving (json format instead of random strings)
Better styling on the .XML side
Better layout to include features and the ease for features to be extended
More usage of android studio capabilities
Hopefully finish at some point and put the app on the play store
